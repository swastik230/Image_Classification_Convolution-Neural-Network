CNN classification part:-1 series
                                                                                                         
  a>IMPORTS:-The necessary libraries are imported, including PyTorch and torchvision.

  b>Data Loading:-
                                                                                                               
  -The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and transformed. The images are converted to tensors and normalized.
                                                                                                               
  -Data loaders are created for both the training and test datasets.

  c>CNN Model Definition:-

  -A simple CNN architecture is defined with three convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers.

  -The 'forward' method defines how the input data passes through the network.
