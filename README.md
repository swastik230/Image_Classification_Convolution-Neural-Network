CNN classification part:-1 series
                                                                                                         
  a>IMPORTS:-The necessary libraries are imported, including PyTorch and torchvision.

  b>Data Loading:-
   The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and transformed. The images are converted to tensors and normalized.

   Data loaders are created for both the training and test datasets.
